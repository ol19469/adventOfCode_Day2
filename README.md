This project processes multi-line numerical input and determines how many lines are "safe" based on specific rules. A line is considered safe if:

Each number differs from the next by 1 to 3.
The sequence is consistently increasing or decreasing.
If a line is not safe, the program attempts to remove a single number to make it safe.
